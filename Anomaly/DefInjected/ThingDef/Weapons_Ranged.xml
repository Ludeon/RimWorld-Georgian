  <Gun_Incinerator.description>A heavy weapon that can spray a stream of flame into an area. It can shoot in an arc over allies without harming them. The flame burns off rapidly, so it will only ignite the most flammable targets.\n\nWhile the main flamethrower can be used without limit, the weapon also comes equipped with a bioferrite-powered mega-burner unit which generates a massive blast of flame from a pressurized bioferrite charge. The mega-burner unit must be refueled after each use.</Gun_Incinerator.description>
