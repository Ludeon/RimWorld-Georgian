  <ArchonexusCore.description>The central core of an archonexus. Its broad surfaces are perfectly clean, and they somehow appear both flat and curved at the same time.\n\nTo most, its purpose seems unknowable. However, some say this is part of an archotech itself, and that the one who finds it can invoke the power of the machine god.\n\nThe psychic power it emanates is terrifyingly loud and complex, yet dead silent. It is heard without ears, felt without skin, seen without eyes, known without memory. It is the thoughts of a being from another plane of existence. The perceptions are reflected directly into any human mind who ventures too close, and few can hold onto their humanity for long under such mental pressure. Only the psychically-deaf are immune.</ArchonexusCore.description>

  <ArchotechTower.description>მიწიდან ამოსული საშუალო ზომის არქოტექნიკური კოშკი. მისი ზედაპირის გასწვრივ კვალი სტაბილურად ანათებს უცნაური ფერით. ადამიანებს მხოლოდ მისი მიზნის გამოცნობა შეუძლიათ.</ArchotechTower.description>

  <GrandArchotechStructure.description>A grand archotech structure of towering height and impressive bulk. The shape is hard to perceive, and the surfaces seem to flow when stared at too long. It could have appeared moments ago, or been here thousands of years.\n\nIt emanates intense psychic influence, forcing thoughts and perceptions directly into the mind of anyone who ventures too close. The emanations are not aggressive, but they are utterly alien and impossible to ignore. Sensations unlinked from time or space, the endless rumination of an inhuman mind a billion times larger - the weak-minded lose themselves quickly under. Only the psychically-deaf are immune.</GrandArchotechStructure.description>

  <MajorArchotechStructure.description>A large archotech structure. The dull green surface is utterly pristine and undamaged, and so smooth that it's slippery. There is no way to guess how long it has been here, and its purpose seems unfathomable.\n\nThe psychic power it emanates isn't aggressive, but it is overwhelming and inhuman. Like standing inside a threshing machine of whirling blades, inside the heartbeat of a sleeping giant, inside a tight tunnel and you can't move or speak or breathe... Anyone who goes near it will become unsettled unless they are psychically deaf.</MajorArchotechStructure.description>
