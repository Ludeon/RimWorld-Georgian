  <Fishing.helpText>Place a 'fishing zone' where your colonists will fish. Larger bodies of water are better for fishing.\n\nFishing reduces the fish population in a body of water.\n\nAvoid overfishing - fewer fish will be caught if a body of water has under 300 fish.\n\nColonists with a high animals skill catch more fish faster.</Fishing.helpText>

  <Gravship.helpText>Build a gravship around your grav engine. When you launch the ship will carry the entire structure to a new map.\n\nLaunching the gravship destroys the current map. You can build a grav anchor to prevent this.\n\nTo launch, a gravship needs:\n     - Pilot console\n     - Fuel tanks\n     - Thrusters\n\nResearch 'basic gravtech' to unlock these.\n\nYou can only build a limited amount of substructure. To increase this limit, find gravcores and gravlite panels.\n\nGravship substructure can be removed using the 'remove foundation' designator.\n\nYour grav engine will occasionally detect gravtech around the planet and mark it on your world map.</Gravship.helpText>

  <Orbit.helpText>On the world map, use the 'view planet' and 'view orbit' buttons to switch between planetary and orbital views.\n\nYou can travel to orbital locations using transport pods, shuttles, or gravships.\n\nColonists need vacsuits or other advanced armor to survive in the vacuum of space.\n\nIf using a gravship, make sure it's well-heated. Build oxygen pumps to maintain breathable air and enclose your ship with airtight walls and doors. Avoid using wood or stone for exterior walls and doors.\n\nPlan your return trip before you launch. Living in orbit for a long time is very challenging. Getting stranded in orbit is deadly.</Orbit.helpText>
